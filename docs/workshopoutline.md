# Anti-Collusion QF Workshop

## Introduction
- Concept and Importance of QF: Discuss the concept of Quadratic Funding (QF) and its significance.
- Mechanism of Fund Allocation and Mathematical Basis: Explore the mechanism of fund distribution and its mathematical foundations.
- Attack Vectors of QF: Reference the document "How to Attack and Defend Quadratic Funding".
  - Notable attack vectors include Sybil attacks, where attackers create numerous fake accounts to manipulate the system, and collusion, where malicious real users secretly coordinate to manipulate the system.
- Current Measures Against These Attacks:
  - Measures against Sybil attacks include the "1Person, 1ID" approach (Idena, BrightID, Proof of Humanity) and the "Humanity Score" concept to complicate the creation of multiple accounts, as used in Gitcoin Passport.
  - Measures against collusion include Pairwise quadratic funding. (Timeline of Plural QF)
  - Example of Plural QF: In a scenario like "elderly vs others" in Japanese elections, politicians tend to optimize for the former due to vote count. If the focus shifts from vote count to "diversity of votes received," it becomes necessary to gain support from all age groups.

## Simulation
- Experience Both Regular QF and Collusion-Resistant Plural QF: Participants will be given Persona Cards with details like age, hobbies, gender, etc., and a budget.
- Role-Playing and Donation Simulation: In a city with various public goods projects, participants will donate as their personas to the projects they are likely to support.
- Comparing the Amounts Received by Each Project in Regular QF vs. Plural QF:
  - Calculations for the regular QF version (not considering the identity of donors).
  - Calculations for Plural QF, clustering by age, and then by other factors like gender, income, etc.

## Discussion
- Debate on Fairness and Effectiveness: Participants discuss which method they think is more fair and effective based on the simulation results.
- Exchange of Views from a Political Philosophical Perspective: Discuss the importance of vote count and diversity.
- No Definitive Answer: The question of "which is better?" is a political philosophical issue without a definitive answer. However, the ability to observe more than just vote count has become technically possible, leading to a new interpretation of "What is Plurality?" as a governance technology.

## Recap
- Discussion on Effectiveness and Potential Issues: Participants discuss situations where each method is effective or might pose problems.
- Sharing Insights: Participants share insights gained from the simulation and discussion.
- Collecting Ideas and Proposals: Solicit ideas and proposals for improving QF and Plural QF.
- Providing Resources: Offer resources for further research and practice in QF and Plural QF.
